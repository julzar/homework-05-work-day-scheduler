# homework-05-work-day-scheduler

On load, page displays nine one-hour time blocks (9am-5pm). Each block consists 
of the time(hour), an input field, and a save button.

Blocks in the past have a grey background, and their input field is disabled. 
Current hour block has a red background. Blocks in the future have a green background.

When the 'save' button for a time block is clicked, any text in the input field of that 
block will be saved to local storage. If the page is reloaded, any saved text will be displayed in
the appropriate block.
